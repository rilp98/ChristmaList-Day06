# Christma List

This is a christmas challenge that consists of a To Do List of Christmas gifts. It has two inputs, one to put the name of the gift and the other for the amount of it. The user can add, delete each gift or delete the entire list.

I am using React.js because I want to practice it and learn more about it. 

In this project I practice the UseState, UseEffect, LocalStorage and conditionals.
